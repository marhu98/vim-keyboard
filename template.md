# vim-{input_file}
A simple vim(neovim) plugin which sets a keymap appropriate for {input_file} users.
That don't want to remember new key bindings.

In summary:

- Bind keys in insert mode to {input_file} keyboard.

- Preserves the QWERTY (or whatever your keyboard is) bindings on normal, visual and command modes
so you don't have to retrain your musle memory.
